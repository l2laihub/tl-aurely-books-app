# T.L. Aurely Logo Update Instructions

## Overview

This directory contains files to help you update the T.L. Aurely Books app with the new logo image. The Header component has already been modified to use the new logo image, but you need to save the actual image file to this directory.

## Steps to Update the Logo

1. **Save the Logo Image**:
   - Save the T.L. Aurely logo image (the one with puzzle pieces, stars, an open book, and a feather) to this directory (`public/images/`) as `tl-aurely-logo.png`.
   - The image should be in PNG format with a transparent background for best results.

2. **Verify the Update**:
   - After saving the image, run the application to see the updated logo in the header.
   - The logo should appear in place of the previous book icon.

## Additional Information

- The Header component (`src/components/Header.tsx`) has been updated to use the new logo image with the following code:
  ```jsx
  <img 
    src="/images/tl-aurely-logo.png" 
    alt="T.L. Aurely Logo" 
    className="h-12 w-auto"
  />
  ```

- If you need to adjust the size or styling of the logo, you can modify the `className` property in the Header component.

- If the logo appears too large or small, you can adjust the `h-12` class to a different size (e.g., `h-10` for smaller, `h-14` for larger).

## Troubleshooting

If the logo doesn't appear after saving the image:

1. Make sure the image is saved with the correct filename: `tl-aurely-logo.png`
2. Verify that the image is saved in the correct location: `public/images/`
3. Check the browser console for any errors related to loading the image
4. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page
