# Logo Image Instructions

1. Save the T.L. Aurely logo image (the one with puzzle pieces, stars, an open book, and a feather) to this directory (`public/images/`) as `tl-aurely-logo.png`.

2. The logo has already been referenced in the Header component, so once you save the image file here, the app will display it automatically.

3. The image should be in PNG format with a transparent background for best results.

4. If you need to adjust the size of the logo in the header, you can modify the `className` property of the img tag in `src/components/Header.tsx`.
