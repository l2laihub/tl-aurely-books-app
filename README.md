# T.L. Aurely Books Platform

## Logo Update Instructions

To update the application with the new T.L. Aurely logo:

1. Save the logo image to `public/images/tl-aurely-logo.png`
2. You can use one of the following methods:
   - Run `node scripts/save-logo.js` and follow the prompts
   - For Windows users: Double-click on `save-logo.bat`
   - For Mac/Linux users: Run `./save-logo.sh` (you may need to make it executable with `chmod +x save-logo.sh`)
3. After saving the logo, run the application to see the updated header

For more detailed instructions, see the README.md file in the `public/images` directory.

## Storage Setup Instructions

To enable file uploads for the materials in the admin panel, you need to:

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Storage â†’ Create a new bucket
3. Name the bucket `materials`
4. Set the bucket's public access level as needed (public read is recommended)
5. Add appropriate policies to control who can upload files

Without this bucket, the application will fall back to using file references only, and uploads will not be stored in Supabase storage.
