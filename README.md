# Literary Haven - Children's Book Platform

## Storage Setup Instructions

To enable file uploads for the materials in the admin panel, you need to:

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Storage â†’ Create a new bucket
3. Name the bucket `materials`
4. Set the bucket's public access level as needed (public read is recommended)
5. Add appropriate policies to control who can upload files

Without this bucket, the application will fall back to using file references only, and uploads will not be stored in Supabase storage.
